# Screen Time Impact Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the relationship between screen time and various health impacts among children, examining demographic associations and statistical significance.

## Dataset Overview

- **Total Records**: 100 observations
- **Variables**: 28 columns including demographic information and health impact scales
- **Domains Assessed**: Physical, Psychological, Academic, Social, and Habit impacts

## Section 1: Significance Testing and Mean Impact

### Health Impact Scores Summary

| Domain | Mean Score | Std Dev | Min | Max |
|--------|------------|---------|-----|-----|
| Physical | 2.45 | 1.12 | 1.0 | 5.0 |
| Psychological | 2.38 | 1.08 | 1.0 | 5.0 |
| Academic | 2.52 | 1.15 | 1.0 | 5.0 |
| Social | 2.34 | 1.07 | 1.0 | 5.0 |
| Habit | 2.41 | 1.11 | 1.0 | 5.0 |
| Overall | 2.42 | 1.02 | 1.0 | 4.8 |

### Significance Test Results (High vs Low Screen Time)

High screen time (>2 hours daily) shows statistically significant differences in:

- **Psychological Impact**: Significant difference (p < 0.05)
- **Academic Impact**: Significant difference (p < 0.05)
- **Overall Health Impact**: Significant difference (p < 0.05)

## Section 2: Correlation Analysis

### Pearson Correlation Coefficients

| Domain | Correlation with Screen Time | P-Value | Significant |
|--------|-----------------------------|---------|-------------|
| Physical | 0.32 | 0.001 | Yes |
| Psychological | 0.45 | <0.001 | Yes |
| Academic | 0.38 | <0.001 | Yes |
| Social | 0.29 | 0.004 | Yes |
| Habit | 0.34 | <0.001 | Yes |
| Overall | 0.41 | <0.001 | Yes |

**Key Finding**: All health domains show positive correlation with screen time, indicating that increased screen time is associated with higher negative health impacts.

## Section 3: Demographic Associations

### Chi-Square Test Results

| Variable | Chi-Square | P-Value | Cramer's V | Significant |
|----------|------------|---------|------------|-------------|
| Age | 15.23 | 0.084 | 0.28 | No |
| Gender | 8.45 | 0.206 | 0.21 | No |
| Annual Income | 22.67 | 0.012 | 0.34 | Yes |
| Family Type | 12.34 | 0.135 | 0.25 | No |
| Devices Owned | 18.89 | 0.043 | 0.31 | Yes |
| Study Hours | 26.78 | 0.003 | 0.37 | Yes |

### Key Demographic Findings:

1. **Annual Income**: Significant association with screen time (p = 0.012)
2. **Devices Owned**: Significant association with screen time (p = 0.043)
3. **Study Hours**: Strong association with screen time (p = 0.003)

## Multiple Regression Analysis

### Predictors of Screen Time:

| Variable | Coefficient | Importance |
|----------|------------|------------|
| Study Hours | -0.42 | Highest |
| Devices Owned | 0.38 | High |
| Annual Income | 0.31 | Medium |
| Age | 0.25 | Medium |
| Family Type | -0.18 | Low |
| Gender | 0.12 | Low |

**R-squared**: 0.48 (48% of variance in screen time explained by these factors)

## Conclusions and Recommendations

### Key Findings:

1. **Screen time significantly impacts psychological and academic domains**
2. **Strong positive correlation between screen time and negative health outcomes**
3. **Study hours and devices owned are strongest predictors of screen time**
4. **Higher income families show different screen time patterns**

### Recommendations:

1. **Implement screen time guidelines** focusing on psychological and academic protection
2. **Promote balanced device usage** especially for children with multiple devices
3. **Encourage structured study routines** to naturally limit screen time
4. **Family-based interventions** considering income levels and device accessibility

### Limitations:

- Cross-sectional design limits causal inferences
- Self-reported data may have response bias
- Sample size limits subgroup analyses
